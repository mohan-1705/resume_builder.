---

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Project Structure

* `main.py` — FastAPI app and extraction logic
* `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

## Notes

* Temporary files are used to store uploaded PDFs during processing.
* Extraction is based on keyword matching and basic NLP; accuracy depends on resume format.
